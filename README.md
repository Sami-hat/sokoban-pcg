A procedural Content Generation Tool for Sokoban

My Dissertation Project, exploring PCG for a PSPACE-COMPLETE Problem - Sokoban

To generate levels yourself:

1. Modify the grid size and box count in the Generation Script

2a. Run the GUI for unoptimised levels

2b. Run the bulk generation script for a larger list of puzzles which are ranked and sorted. Run the GUI with these seeds
